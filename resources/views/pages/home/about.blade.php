            <p>When Can You Do It, or "Whendi" as we like to call it, is a cloud-based appointment book that
            can be updated by you, your employees, and your customers. Finally, you can do away with
            19th-century paper ledgers and go fully online, without needing to worry about servers or software.</p>
            <p><strong>Whendi</strong> is accessible from cell phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops by using
            your browser or our forthcoming apps for Android and Apple devices.</p>

            <p>Traditional paper-based systems fail because they can only be one place and seen if you're
            standing right over them. Simple tasks like getting an appointment require a customer to call
            your business and take an employee away from their primary job while they try to find a good
            time slot for the customer as part of a phone-based transaction.</p>
            <p>Using our onlines system <strong>Whendi</strong>, a customer can easily look up your employees'
            availability and reserve an appointment. And with a glance at <strong>Whendi</strong> on your
            favorite device, you can instantly see your day's schedule. This makes life a lot easier for you,
            for your employees, and for your customers.</p>
